This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and infinite lists. The function `calculateSums` attempts to compute the sum of squares for a potentially infinite list.  However, due to lazy evaluation, the `sum` function will not terminate if the input list is infinite, even if only a finite number of elements are needed for the `take` function.

```haskell
import Data.List

calculateSums :: Int -> [Int]
calculateSums n = take n $ map (^2) [1..] 

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = sum $ calculateSums 5
  print result
```
